    "story": "This painted enamel plywood piece is a allusion to Krapp’s Last Tape (1958) a one-act play by Samuel Beckett, written for actor Patrick Magee and later considered one of Beckett’s major works. It portrays Krapp, an aging man, as he listens to recordings of his younger self reflecting on ambition, love, and loss, while making a new recording that reveals his bitterness and decline. The play explores themes of memory, regret, and the passage of time through the metaphor of tape recordings, set against stark imagery of light and dark.",
